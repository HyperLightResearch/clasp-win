**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Actual behavior**
A clear and concise description of what happened instead.

**Code at issue**

```lisp
If applicable, example code that can be evaluated or compiled to reproduce the problem.
Ideally, this is short and self contained.
If it is not practicable to eliminate dependencies, please at least try to reduce them.
```

**Other steps to reproduce**
If the problem cannot be reproduced from just a code sample, include other steps here.
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Etc.

**Context**
* Versions or commit hashes of Clasp on which you observed the problem (if you have built from up to date source, saying so is fine, you don't need to dig around for hashes)
* If relevant, your operating system and other aspects of your computing environment
* If you believe the compiler may be at fault, relevant declarations, including optimize settings (use `(clasp-cltl2:declaration-information 'optimize)`)
* Any other context about the problem
